# Tutorial 8 - Publisher

a. In a single run, the publisher program sends five distinct messages to the message broker. This is determined by the fact that it invokes the "publish_event" function five times within its main function, each time with different data payloads.

b. The URL amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672 being the same in both the publisher and subscriber programs indicates that they are configured to connect to the same AMQP server using identical connection parameters. Here's a breakdown:

amqp:// specifies that the AMQP protocol is being used for messaging.
guest:guest represents the credentials for authentication, with "guest" as both the username and the password.
localhost:5672 points to the host and port where the AMQP server is accessible, indicating that the server is hosted locally on the default AMQP port, 5672.

# Running RabbitMQ as message broker

Essentially, the publisher sends messages to the RabbitMQ broker, and the subscriber retrieves and processes these messages, as seen on their respective consoles. This setup illustrates how data is transmitted from the publisher to the subscriber, with RabbitMQ serving as the intermediary.

The chart in the image details the publisherâ€™s message transmission rates over the last minute, offering insights into the operational load of the messaging system. By tracking this metric, one can discern the frequency and intensity of message dispatches from the publisher. This measurement is crucial for understanding the real-time dynamics of the messaging system's throughput.

When the 'message rates last minute' are high, it indicates that the publisher is actively sending out a substantial number of messages, suggesting a heavier operational load. This might be during peak usage times or when transmitting bulk data updates. Conversely, lower rates indicate fewer messages are being sent, which could signify less demand or idle periods.
